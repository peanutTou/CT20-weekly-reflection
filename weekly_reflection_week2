It is exceting in my second week. I learned many new technologies in javascript. Many usful functions help me built my program. Functions like torus(), 
rotate() helps me create amazing effect. It is fun to play around with variables, so my output can change every frames. Combine different variables with
different shape, I can crate many amazing animations.
